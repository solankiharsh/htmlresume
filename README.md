# htmlresume
First, I created a simple html resume and included my basic details. I created a Github repository and added my assets, css and site.html file. 

<p> The next step of the challenge was to upload these files to my newly created S3 bucket. I also setup my bucket to host a static website. Once these steps were completed, I could visit my newly created site. </p>

<p> I skipped around the challenge somewhat and went ahead and created my website counter and javascript. I added these files to both my repository and S3 bucket. Finally my website counter is on my static website and working properly. I connected this with my Github repository so that code/documentation changes made going forward would be reflected in my bucket. I will be attaching this short write-up to my Github repository code and if all goes well it will be displayed on my static website.
